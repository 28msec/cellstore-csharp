There are two ways to create an archive: a full import of an XBRL instance and taxonomy out of a ZIP file, or a new empty archive with a JSON object containing its metadata.  A full import is performed by provided, in the body of the request, a ZIP Deflate-compressed archive. This will import all the facts from the instance, as well as the taxonomy schema and linkbases.  Alternatively, a new empty archive can be created by submitting a JSON object containing general information about the archive. This JSON object must be valid agains a JSound schema. It can be either taken from the output of a GET request to the same endpoint (in which case it will be valid), or created manually.
