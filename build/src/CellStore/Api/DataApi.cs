For convenience, we offer a user-friendly summary of the fields involved.

The profile-specific information must have a Name field containing the profile name, that is, identical to its key. The other fields in the profile information is not restricted. |  Additionally, the following fields are allowed for the purpose of feeding back the output of the sections endpoint as input:  - Components (string) - ReportElements (string) - FactTable (string) - Spreadsheet (string) - Category (string) - SubCategory (string) - Disclosure (string) - NumRules (integer) - NumReportElements (integer) - NumHypercubes (integer) - NumDimensions (integer) - NumMembers (integer) - NumLineItems (integer) - NumAbstracts (integer) - NumConcepts (integer) - EntityRegistrantName (string) - CIK (string) - FiscalYear (integer) - FiscalPeriod (string) - AcceptanceDatetime (string) - FormType (string)  Several empty sections can be created at the same time by posting a sequence of non-comma-separated JSON objects as above.
